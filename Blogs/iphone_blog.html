<h2>Unparalleled Customization</h2>

<p>With iOS 18, Apple has introduced new ways for users to personalize their iPhones. Users can now arrange apps and widgets in any open space on the Home Screen, including placing them above the dock for quick access or perfectly framing a wallpaper. App icons and widgets can adopt a dark or tinted effect and can be resized to suit individual preferences.</p>

<p>For the first time, users can also customize the controls at the bottom of the Lock Screen. This includes choosing from options available in the controls gallery or removing them entirely. The new Action button on the iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max allows users to quickly invoke controls from the gallery, enhancing accessibility.</p>

<p>The Control Center has been redesigned to provide easier access to frequently used controls. It now offers new levels of customization and flexibility, with quick access to groups such as media playback, Home controls, and connectivity, and the ability to easily swipe between these groups.</p>

<h2>Photos: A Unified and Dynamic Experience</h2>

<p>The Photos app has undergone its biggest-ever redesign in iOS 18. The app now features a simplified, single view with a familiar grid layout. New collections allow users to browse by themes without the need to organize content into albums. Favorite collections can be pinned for easy access, and a new carousel view presents daily highlights featuring favorite people, pets, places, and more.</p>

<p>Autoplaying content throughout the app brings photo libraries to life, allowing users to relive past moments while browsing. This dynamic new design makes it easier than ever to find and enjoy cherished memories.</p>

<h3>Memories and Clean Up Tools</h3>

<p>The new Memories feature in Photos lets users create the stories they want to see just by typing a description. Apple Intelligence will pick out the best photos and videos based on the description, craft a storyline with chapters based on themes identified from the photos, and arrange them into a movie with its own narrative arc. Additionally, a new Clean Up tool can identify and remove distracting objects in the background of a photo without accidentally altering the subject.</p>

<h2>Big Updates to Safari</h2>

<p>Safari, the world’s fastest browser, now offers an even easier way to discover information on the web with Highlights and a redesigned Reader experience. Using machine learning, Safari can surface key information about a webpage. Users can review a summary to get the gist of an article, see the location of a restaurant, hotel, or landmark, or listen to an artist’s track right from an article about the song or album. The redesigned Reader offers more ways to enjoy articles without distraction, including a summary and table of contents for longer articles.</p>

<h2>Enhancements to Mail</h2>

<p>Later this year, Mail will introduce new ways for users to manage their inbox and stay up to date. On-device categorization organizes and sorts incoming email into Primary for personal and time-sensitive emails, Transactions for confirmations and receipts, Updates for news and social notifications, and Promotions for marketing emails and coupons. Mail also features a new digest view that pulls together all of the relevant emails from a business, allowing users to quickly scan for what’s important in the moment.</p>

<h2>Enhanced Connectivity and Privacy Features</h2>

<p>iOS 18 introduces Messages over satellite, allowing users to communicate via the Messages app when cellular or Wi-Fi connections are unavailable. This feature builds on Apple's existing satellite capabilities and ensures users can stay connected in remote areas.</p>

<p>Privacy remains a core focus for Apple, and iOS 18 introduces new tools to manage app visibility, contact sharing, and accessory connections. Locked and hidden apps ensure that sensitive information remains private, offering peace of mind to users.</p>

<h2>Introducing the Passwords App</h2>

<p>Building on the foundation of Keychain, Apple has introduced the new Passwords app. This app makes it easy for users to access their passwords, passkeys, Wi-Fi passwords, and verification codes. This centralization of security information enhances convenience while maintaining Apple's high standards for privacy and security.</p>

<h2>Apple Intelligence: Transforming the iPhone Experience</h2>

<p>The highlight of iOS 18 is the introduction of Apple Intelligence, a personal intelligence system that combines generative models with personal context to deliver highly relevant and useful insights. Deeply integrated into iOS 18, iPadOS 18, and macOS Sequoia, Apple Intelligence leverages the power of Apple silicon to understand and create language and images, perform actions across apps, and simplify everyday tasks.</p>

<p>With privacy built from the ground up, Apple Intelligence offers new system-wide Writing Tools that enable users to rewrite, proofread, and summarize text across various apps, including Mail, Notes, Pages, and third-party applications.</p>

<h2>More Features and Enhancements</h2>
