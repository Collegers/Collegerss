        <p>
            The NDA, led by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), has secured an absolute majority in the Lok Sabha, winning a total of 292 seats. The BJP itself has emerged as the single largest party, claiming 240 seats out of the 543 that were contested. This victory underscores the enduring appeal of the BJP and its leadership under Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who has been a central figure in the party's strategy and outreach efforts.

            The event will witness the attendance of several national and international dignitaries. Among the prominent figures present will be Defence Minister Rajnath Singh, Union Minister of State for Defence Ajay Bhatt, Chief of Defence Staff General Anil Chauhan, and Chief of Army Staff General Manoj Pande. Additionally, several leaders from neighboring countries, including the President of Sri Lanka, the President of Maldives, the Prime Minister of Bangladesh, and other dignitaries from Nepal, Bhutan, and Seychelles, have confirmed their participation.

        <h2>Security Measures</h2>
        <p>
            In light of the high-profile nature of the event, security has been significantly heightened across the capital. The Rashtrapati Bhavan will be under a stringent three-tier security system until June 11. The Delhi-NCT area has been declared a no-fly zone to ensure the safety of the participants and to prevent any security breaches involving drones or other aerial devices. Approximately 2,500 police and paramilitary personnel have been deployed to maintain law and order.

        <h2>Council of Ministers</h2>
        <p>
            Alongside Narendra Modi, members of his council of ministers will also take their oaths today. Media reports suggest that while the entire council may not be sworn in today, approximately thirty ministers are expected to take their oaths. The new council is anticipated to include 78 to 81 leaders, reflecting a greater reliance on coalition partners compared to previous terms.
