        <h2>The Beginning of Collegers</h2>
        <p>
            On June 5, 2024, at 5 PM, we proudly launched our website, Collegers, under the umbrella of our parent company, Astra Knight. Our mission was clear from the start: to provide the latest news and world trends across a variety of topics including crypto, gaming, politics, education, development, the military, international trade, and trending social media content.
        </p>

        <h2>The Founders' Vision</h2>
        <p>
            The creators of Collegers, two anonymous individuals, have always been passionate about uncovering the truth. Throughout history, we have seen numerous instances of fake news spreading, causing confusion and harm. From political scandals to manipulated economic reports, the impact of false information has been far-reaching and damaging. Disillusioned by the constant stream of manipulated news from mainstream media and large social media pages, they decided to take a stand.While still in college, these founders observed national news channels prioritizing TRP over truth, leading to the dissemination of fake news that incited unnecessary panic and unrest. Media houses and influential social media pages often spread distorted news for financial gain, compromising the integrity of the information available to the public
        </p>
        <h2>Our First Steps</h2>
        <p>
            Just two days after our website went live, on June 7, 2024, we published our first blog post. This marked the beginning of our journey in delivering authentic and reliable news to our audience. Our inspiration stemmed from our experiences as college students. Even now, while still in college, we witnessed firsthand the detrimental effects of fake news and media manipulation on our country, India, and the world.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Our Mission</h2>
        <p>
            Determined to combat this wave of misinformation, they decided to create Collegers as a platform that would provide news that is fact-checked and reliable. They are fully aware of the risks involved in exposing the truth, which is why they have chosen to remain anonymous. By daring to speak the reality and challenging corruption, they risk their safety to ensure that the world knows the truth.
        </p>
        <h2>Our Promise</h2>
        <p>
            At Collegers, we are committed to providing real news that is free from the influence of dirty politics and monetary manipulation. Our aim is to empower people with truthful information and foster a well-informed community. The anonymity of our founders is a testament to the courage and dedication required to fight against the tide of misinformation. They understand the potential dangers but are driven by the conviction that the world deserves to know the truth.
        </p>
        <h2>Our Vision</h2>
        <p>
            We envision a world where news is not manipulated for ulterior motives. Collegers stands as a beacon of truth in an era plagued by misinformation. We believe in a successful world built on the foundation of genuine and transparent news.
        </p>
