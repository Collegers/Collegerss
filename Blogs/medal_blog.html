        <p>Tomar's debut in the UFC was nothing short of remarkable. Facing Rayanne dos Santos at strawweight in the very first bout of the card, Tomar engaged in a grueling 15-minute battle that kept fans on the edge of their seats.

We are going all the way up! We are not going to stop! We'll become a UFC champion soon! This win is not my win, it's for all Indian fans and all Indian fighters," Tomar passionately declared. Her pride was palpable as she carried the Indian flag into the Octagon, a symbol of her dedication and love for her country.</p>

        <p>Puja Tomar's success is a milestone in the UFC's journey as well, reflecting the growing diversity and inclusivity in the sport. UFC Senior Vice President and Head of Asia, Kevin Chang, expressed his excitement about Tomar's future, saying, "Puja Tomar is a pioneer for women's MMA in India, and her win made history. We are looking forward to Puja continuing to put on amazing performances as she represents India."</p>
