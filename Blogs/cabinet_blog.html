        <h1>Modi 3.0: New Cabinet Ministers and Their Portfolios</h1>
    </header>
    <div class="container">

        <p>Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Narendra Modi has become India’s Prime Minister for a third consecutive
            term. On June 9, Modi took the oath as Prime Minister, along with the induction of the new ministerial
            council. The makeup of the Council of Ministers – 72 members, including the Prime Minister – reflects the
            NDA’s delicate balancing act as Modi will be steering a coalition government. The new Union Cabinet has,
            however, opted for continuity, with several portfolios allocated along the lines of the previous NDA
            administration.</p>

        <p>The National Democratic Alliance (NDA), led by Narendra Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), has assumed
            power at the federal level of government in India after winning a third straight term in the 18th Lok Sabha
            elections.</p>

        <p>On Monday evening, June 10, Prime Minister Modi assigned portfolios to his 71 Council of Ministers. The
            complete list was made public after the inaugural meeting of the new Union Cabinet, which took place at the
            Prime Minister’s residence. With a few exceptions, notable major BJP leaders will retain their previous
            roles under the Modi 3.0 administration. Senior BJP party leaders Amit Shah, Rajnath Singh, Nirmala
            Sitharaman, and S. Jaishankar will continue to lead the four key ministries of Home, Defense, Finance, and
            External Affairs, respectively.</p>

        <p>Prime Minister Modi took the oath of office in a grand ceremony held at the presidential palace in New Delhi
            on June 9. The swearing-in event drew thousands of invited attendees, including leaders from Bangladesh,
            Nepal, Sri Lanka, and the Maldives, a testament to India’s ‘Neighbourhood First’ policy.</p>

        <h2>New and Old Faces in the NDA Government</h2>

        <p>The Modi Government 3.0’s new Council of Ministers includes new members and some familiar faces from the
            previous cabinet. The BJP’s allies in the NDA were awarded a sizable representation of 11 portfolios. This
            will be the first time the BJP has not held a complete majority in the Lok Sabha (lower house of the Indian
            parliament) since 2014.</p>

        <p>In Andhra Pradesh, where the NDA won 21 out of 25 Lok Sabha seats, two MPs each from the Telugu Desam Party
            (TDP) and the BJP took the oath of office. Alongside Modi, 71 ministers took an oath on Sunday, administered
            by India’s President Droupadi Murmu.</p>

        <p>It is noteworthy that two members of the BJP, namely L. Murugan from Tamil Nadu and Ravneet Singh from
            Punjab, are included in the recently announced cabinet despite their respective losses in elections.</p>
